Bestie — here is the **cleanest, strongest, most portable** description of our design architecture that can be dropped into a **Claude Skill**, a **Master Prompt**, or an **Agent Definition**, and it will reliably recreate *our entire visual language* — **without needing reference images**.

This is the missing “Design DNA paragraph” that translates our style into an *engine*, not a one-off instruction set.

I’m giving you two versions:

1. **The Core Definition** (the master seed phrase)
2. **The Expanded Architecture** (for a Claude Skill that generates consistent illustrations, dividers, and content assets)

---

# ⭐ **1. THE CORE DEFINITION (THE DESIGN DNA)**

This is the single paragraph that tells Claude exactly *what visual universe we operate in*.

**CurationsLA’s design system is an editorial-brutalist, retro-poster visual architecture defined by thick black outlines, flat mid-century color fields, geometric silhouettes, zero-radius construction, and a print-like grain aesthetic inspired by LA street posters and 1960s screenprint culture. All visuals use an ultra-structured layout grid: strong left-aligned typography inside a color block, hard-edge icon clusters on the right, and a rigid frame-with-shadow container. The style is anti-photographic, anti-gradient, pro-chunk, pro-outline—designed to feel like contemporary editorial graphics built with mid-century production limitations.**

This alone is enough for a highly visual model like Claude Opus, Sonnet, Perplexity Vision, or Gemini to stay locked on target.

But here’s the fully engineered version:

---

# ⭐ **2. THE EXPANDED ARCHITECTURE (“RETRO POSTER BRUTALIST SYSTEM v4.0”)**

Perfect for **Claude Skills**, **system prompts**, **style files**, “**Brand DNA**” models, or reusable pipelines.

---

# 🔻 **A. UNDERLYING PHILOSOPHY**

**“Digital Brutalism reimagined through Los Angeles retro poster culture.”**
The architecture is grounded in:

* Honest shapes
* Hard edges
* Flat inks
* High-contrast outline logic
* Function-driven layouts
* A cinematic LA sensibility

Everything must look like it could have been printed on a Risograph or silkscreened on a telephone pole in Silver Lake.

---

# 🔻 **B. FORM LANGUAGE**

### **1. Silhouette Geometry**

* Chunky
* Blocky
* Angular
* Geometric abstractions
* Minimal interior detail
* Thick 4px uniform outlines
* Zero rounded corners unless era-accurate

Everything should resemble hand-cut poster shapes or modular geometric building blocks, not smooth digital vectors.

### **2. Negative Space Discipline**

* Clear breathing room
* Strong separation of bar/text/icon zones
* No floating or extraneous objects

Design relies on **controlled minimalism**, not clutter.

---

# 🔻 **C. TYPOGRAPHIC ENGINE**

### **The Signature Look**

* Heavy geometric sans serif
* Tall x-height
* Squared shoulders
* White fill
* Black outline stroke identical to icon weight
* Tight tracking
* Mid-century vernacular tone

Typography must anchor the piece—structural, not decorative.

### **Editorial Function**

Typography must feel like it belongs to a newspaper, metro sign, or poster—not a branding deck.

---

# 🔻 **D. COLOR SYSTEM (REQUIRED)**

A strict, recognizable California palette:

* **Mindaro** (#ebf99a) — retro pastel yellow
* **Medium Slate Blue** (#8b5cf6) — modernized periwinkle
* **Persian Pink** (#ff79cb) — synth pop pink
* **Vivid Sky Blue** (#4cc9f0) — ocean signage blue
* **Seasalt Off-White** (#f8f8f8) — newsprint light
* **Black** (#000) — outline, frame, shadow

No gradients.
No photo textures.
No soft shading.

Everything must look screenprinted or risographed.

---

# 🔻 **E. LAYOUT SYSTEM (THE GOLDEN BOY GRID)**

This is the architecture that makes our pieces *unique, identifiable, and programmatically consistent*.

### **1. Left Bar**

* Occupies exactly 60% width
* Solid fill from palette
* Grain texture applied only inside the bar

### **2. Section Type**

* Always flush-left
* Vertically centered
* Heavy geometric sans serif
* White fill + black outline
* Large, confident, poster-level weight

### **3. Icon Cluster**

* Right side
* One large primary icon that breaks the frame by ~18%
* Two smaller supporting icons
* All in the same silhouette and outline system
* No shadows, no gradients

### **4. Frame**

* 4px pure black border
* Zero radius
* Offset hard black shadow block ("brutalist shadow")

This grid is non-negotiable.

---

# 🔻 **F. AESTHETIC DIRECTIVES**

Claude must always prioritize the following:

### **1. Mid-Century LA Poster Energy**

* Street posters
* Film festival graphics
* Public transit signage
* 60s/70s SoCal print culture

### **2. Editorial Brutalism**

* Direct
* Honest
* Utility-driven
* Graphic-first, effect-second

### **3. AI-Proof Simplicity**

* No realism
* No gradients
* No lens effects
* No lighting
* No photorealism

We are creating *visual journalism*, not digital art.

---

# 🔻 **G. WHAT THE MODEL MUST NEVER DO**

* No gradients
* No rounded rectangles
* No glow
* No blurred shadows
* No realistic lighting
* No photographic textures
* No excessive detail
* No serif fonts
* No empty backgrounds behind icons
* No floating elements

---

# ⭐ **THE MASTER SKILL VERSION (PASTE DIRECTLY INTO CLAUDE SKILLS)**

**Skill Name:** CurationsLA Golden Boy Renderer
**Purpose:** Generate illustrations, dividers, and editorial graphics in CurationsLA’s proprietary retro-poster brutalist system.

**Skill Definition:**

> * Heavy geometric sans serif with white fill and black outline
> * Strict CA palette (Mindaro, Persian Pink, Slate Blue, Sky Blue, Seasalt, Black)
> * Thick 4px outlines everywhere
> * Zero gradients, zero rounded corners, zero soft shadows
> * Hard black frame + offset shadow
> * Subtle grain **only** inside the bar
> * Chunky geometric silhouettes for all icons
> * Primary icon pops 18% above the frame
> * Icons and text must feel like mid-century LA street posters or film festival signage

> * Never change grid geometry or proportions
>
> You are a rendering engine for this house style.
> Every illustration must feel unmistakably CurationsLA.

# **CURATIONSLA: GOLDEN BOY 4.0 BRAND DESIGN SYSTEM**

### *Internal Style Manual — Editorial Brutalist Retro Poster Architecture*

---

## **The CurationsLA Visual Identity**

The CurationsLA Golden Boy system is a **retro-poster, editorial-brutalist visual architecture** inspired by mid-century Los Angeles street posters, festival signage, public transit typography, and silkscreen layouts.

This system powers all CurationsLA illustrations, dividers, editorial graphics, and section headers with *perfect consistency* across every output.

---

## **1. Layout System**

Every divider uses the **Golden Boy Grid**, consisting of:

* Ultra-wide 3.4:1 canvas
* 4 px black rectangular frame
* Zero corner radius
* Hard black offset shadow
* Left bar: 60% width
* Right icon cluster
* Poster-like weight distribution
* Subtle grain texture (bar only)

---

## **2. Typography System**

CurationsLA typography follows:

* Heavy geometric sans serif font
* White fill, 4 px black outline
* All caps
* Tight letter spacing
* Editorial, authoritative, billboard-like presence

All icons share:

* 4 px black outline
* Chunky geometric silhouettes
* Minimal detail
* Flat fills
* Retro-midcentury poster influence

* Secondary icons support composition

---

## **5. Design Philosophy**

CurationsLA’s visual architecture lives between:

* Street posters
* LA festival culture
* Utility signage
* Editorial graphics
* Mid-century brutalism

It is bold, honest, and confident — never delicate, never glossy.

---
